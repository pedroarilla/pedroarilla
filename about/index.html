    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I’m Pedro Arilla (1984—), a designer with a passion for words working as a Type Director at <a href="https://arillatype.studio">Arillatype.Studio®</a> on helping brands worldwide to encapsulate typographically their voices.</p>
    <p>I’ve graduated with Distinction in the world’s top Typeface Design Masters of Reading (UK), worked as a Creative Director at the legendary foundries Fontsmith (UK) and Monotype (USA), led projects for clients such as Google, Amazon, Virgin, Paralympics, MotoGP and FC Barcelona, and designed typefaces in Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Thai and Japanese scripts.</p>
    <p>My job has been awarded and exhibited worldwide. I teach workshops and speak at conferences in universities and events around the globe. I’ve been jury in literary and branding awards. My texts and articles have been translated into distant languages.</p>
    <p>I’m writing a book on type evaluation; I co-organise and teach an international one-week type design workshop (<a href="https://gliglifo.com" target="_blank">Glíglifo</a>); and I wrote one of the main blogs on typography in Spanish for 11 years (<a href="https://donserifa.com" target="_blank">Don Serifa</a>).</p>
    <p>I’m from Ejea de los Caballeros (Zaragoza, Spain). I’ve lived also in Zaragoza (Spain), Reading and London (United Kingdom). Now I am based in La Cala del Moral (Málaga, Spain) because I love blue colour.</p>
    <p>I share my life with Cris — and Bunbury, our dog.</p>
